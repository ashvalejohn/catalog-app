# Tactile README


## See [Tactile](http://ashvalejohn-full-stack.herokuapp.com/#/) in action
__Tactile__ is a shopping app where users can see details about an item by clicking it within an image. Users can browse editorial photographs, click an item they like, then add that item to their cart.

## Clickable Items
Tactile's coolest feature is the ability to click directly on something you like in an image. Like her jacket? *Click it*. Want to know more about those shoes? *Click 'em*. Tactile lets editorial photos ~* come to life *~.

This clickable magic is build using an [HTML image map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map), which renders like this:
```html
  <img useMap="#demoMap" src="cute-outfit.jpg">
  <map id="demoMap">
    <area shape="poly" coords="123, 345, 456, 746, 12, 23, ..." alt="12">
  </map>
```
Every image has a map with several `<area>` tags. Every `<area>` tag references an item in its alt text. When a user clicks an `<area>` tag, they can see the corresponding item's information and add the item to their cart.
